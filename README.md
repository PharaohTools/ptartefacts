Smooth Integration with all other Pharaoh Tools; seamlessly and simply being able to hooking into your Development
Environments, Configuration, Deployments, Tests, Tracked Processes and Managed Orchestration.

    
## Installation

First you'll need to install Git and PHP. If you don't have either, google them - they're easy to install. To install
ptartefacts cli on your On your Mac, Linux or  Unix Machine silently do the following:

git clone https://github.com/PharaohTools/ptartefacts.git && sudo php ptartefacts/install-silent

or on Windows, open a terminal with the "Run as Administrator" option...

git clone https://github.com/PharaohTools/ptartefacts.git && php ptartefacts\install-silent

... that's it, now the ptartefacts command should be available at the command line for you.


## Usage:

So, there are a few simple commands...

First, you can just use

ptartefacts

...This will give you a list of the available modules...

Then you can use

ptartefacts *ModuleName* help

...This will display the help for that module, and tell you a list of available alias for the module command, and the
available actions too.

You'll be able to automate any action from any available module into an autopilot file, or run it from the CLI. I'm
working on a web front end, but you can also use JSON output and the PostInput module to use any module from an API.
