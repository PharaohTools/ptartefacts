This directory contains several keys intended for tests.
There are various types of keys (DSA, RSA, etc.) with different key sizes.

The following structure is used:
- The "encrypted" subfolder contains keys which are passphrase-protected.
  The passphrase for those is "passphrase".
- The "plaintext" subfolder contains the same keys, without a passphrase.


These keys where generated using the following command:

    ssh-keygen -t type -b size -f output_filename -N passphrase


To convert them to PuTTY's Private Key format, use:

    puttygen /path/to/key -P -O private -o output_filename


Notes:

- "ssh-keygen" can be found in the "openssh-client" package on Debian
  and its derivatives.
  Likewise, "puttygen" can be found in the "putty-tools" package.

- Some algorithms have fixed key lengths (eg. ECDSA only supports key
  lengths of 256, 384 or 521 bits).

- Omit the "-N" option to generate passphrase-less keys with "ssh-keygen".

- Press Enter twice to generate a passphrase-less key when converting an
  existing key with "puttygen".
